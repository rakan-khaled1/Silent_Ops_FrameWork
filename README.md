🔥 SilentOps Framework

Author: Rakan Khaled
Platform: Kali Linux
Category: Offensive Security / Penetration Testing
Language: Bash

📌 Overview

SilentOps Framework is a modular, terminal-based offensive security framework built for educational purposes and authorized penetration testing.

The framework unifies server reconnaissance, online brute-force attacks, and offline password cracking into a single interactive menu-driven environment, following realistic penetration testing workflows.

SilentOps is designed to be:

Simple to deploy

Easy to understand

Practical for students and junior red-teamers

Fully compatible with Kali Linux toolsets

⚠️ Legal Disclaimer

This framework is intended ONLY for:

Educational use

Cybersecurity training labs

Authorized penetration testing

🚫 Any use against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal.
The author is not responsible for misuse or damage caused by this tool.

🧩 Framework Structure

SilentOps is divided into two main sections:

🔍 Section 1: server Reconnaissance & Enumeration

Includes:

Email harvesting (theHarvester)

IPv4 & IPv6 enumeration

MX & NS DNS record discovery

Full port scanning & OS detection

Vulnerability scanning (CVSS-based)

SMB enumeration

Web directory brute-force (Gobuster)

💥 Section 2: Attack & Password Cracking
🔐 Online Password Attacks

FTP brute-force (Hydra)

SSH brute-force (Patator)

🧠 Offline Password Attacks

PDF password cracking

ZIP password cracking

MD5 hash cracking

📚 Wordlists & Password Databases

All offline cracking modules rely on a unified password database.

🔑 Default Offline Wordlist

Based on RockYou

Total passwords: 14,341,564

Used consistently across:

PDF cracking

ZIP cracking

Hash cracking

This ensures:

Consistent attack strength

Predictable cracking behavior

Standardized testing results

📌 Users may supply custom wordlists at runtime.

🛠 Installation

SilentOps Framework runs natively on Kali Linux with minimal setup.

1️⃣ Clone or Place the Framework
cd /home/kali/
git clone https://github.com/rakan-khaled1/Silent_Ops_FrameWork.git


Or ensure the folder exists:

/home/kali/Silent_Ops_FrameWork

2️⃣ Navigate to the Directory
cd /home/kali/Silent_Ops_FrameWork

3️⃣ Set Execution Permissions
chmod +x silentops.sh
chmod +x ui_engine.sh


(Adjust filenames if needed.)

4️⃣ Install Required Tools

SilentOps depends on standard Kali Linux utilities:

nmap

theHarvester

gobuster

hydra

patator

john

pdf2john

zip2john

dig

Install missing tools:

sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap theharvester gobuster hydra patator john dnsutils -y

5️⃣ Wordlists Setup

Default wordlists are stored in:

/home/kali/Silent_Ops_FrameWork/


This directory includes:

FTP usernames & passwords

SSH usernames & passwords

PDF / ZIP / HASH wordlists

Web path lists

6️⃣ Run the Framework
sudo bash silentops.sh

📝 Logging & Output

Optional result saving

Timestamped output files

Live output using tee

Organized per execution session

🎯 Design Philosophy

SilentOps was developed with a focus on:

Clean Bash scripting

Modular attack logic

Realistic penetration testing flow

Educational clarity

Minimal dependencies

This is not an automated hacking tool, but a learning-focused offensive framework that reflects real-world methodologies.

🚀 Who Is This For?

Cybersecurity students

Ethical hacking learners

Red team beginners

Lab-based penetration testing

Academic security projects

🧠 Final Notes

Offline cracking efficiency depends on wordlist quality

RockYou remains an industry baseline

SilentOps allows controlled, transparent testing

Always test legally and responsibly

🔥 SilentOps Framework
Stay Silent. Stay Effective.
